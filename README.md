# karma
The karma system from the Pylon server, but better

Trigger: thx/thanks/thank you @someone

See how much karma a user has: `!karma (optional @)`

Cooldown: Once a person has been thanked, nobody can thank that person in the same hour

Copy paste the code in `main.ts`

Alternatively create a file called `karma.ts`, copy paste the code in there and add `import './karma';` on the top of `main.ts`
